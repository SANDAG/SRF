S28_aa model here is the AA only model extracted from the PECAS S28 model released to Manhan Group for QA/QC.
Additional files needed for the run of AA only model, such as jar files and omx files, need to be copied from the original S28 model folder. 

Since git doesn't deal with large files well, and is decentralized, PECAS models use Subversion for version control. To check out the PECAS S28 model, you can download and install tortoisesvn from https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html .

Once tortoisesvn is installed, you can right click in Windows file explorer to bring up the context menu which has items like "SVN Checkout" and tools orgnaized under "Tortoisesvn". Click "SVN Checkout" to check out PECAS S28 model from the following url:
