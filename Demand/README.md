# Bid-rent evaluation of demand for SRF System
The demand portion of the SRF System evaluates the MGRA-level real estate supply stock developed by REDM and the LUZ-level control totals provided by AA using a bid-rent framework.  The R scripts in the "R" folder orchestrate this process and provide an interface to the mu-land program.  These scripts reference a "master" directory which must be populated from an input database.
